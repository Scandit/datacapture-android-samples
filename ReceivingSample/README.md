# Receiving Sample

This samples demonstrates the receiving use case with a combined application of SparkScan and MatrixScan Count (Barcode Count API) depending on the physical set-up.

The pre-built SparkScan and MatrixScan Count components incorporate our best practices for usability and have been rigorously tested with target users in the receiving scenario.

## What is MatrixScan Count?

MatrixScan Count is an out-of-the-box scan and count solution for counting and receiving multiple items at once, in which user interface (UI) elements and interactions are built into a workflow.
